# Deploying an ASP\.NET Web App to AWS<a name="tutorial-eb"></a>

The following tutorial demonstrates how to use the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deploy Application* task to deploy a web application to the AWS Cloud from a Visual Studio Team Services \(VSTS\) build definition\.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>
+ The AWS Tools for VSTS installed in VSTS or an on\-premises Team Foundation Server\.
+ An AWS account and preferably an associated IAM user account\.
+ An AWS Elastic Beanstalk application and environment\.
+ A code project for an *ASP\.NET Web Application \(\.NET Framework\)* or an *ASP\.NET Core Web Application*, which you will push to your VSTS project\.

## Deploying an ASP\.NET Application Using the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deploy Application Task<a name="deploying-an-asp-net-application-using-the-aeblong-deployment-task"></a>

Create a new VSTS project and add a new pipeline to the project based on the *ASP\.NET Core \(\.NET Framework\)* template, which will produce a Web Deploy archive for deployment\. To follow along with the screenshots shown below, use the classic editor \(that is, without YAML\)\.

The build process page for this pipeline contains the following default tasks\.

![\[Build Definition\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vsts/latest/userguide/images/build-definition.png)

### Add the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deploy Application Task to the Build Definition<a name="add-the-aws-elastic-beanstalk-deployment-task-to-the-build-definition"></a>

Select the **"\+" icon** at the top of the task list\. In the right hand panel, optionally enter something in the search box, for example "AWS", and scroll through the available tasks until you see the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deploy Application* task\. Select the **Add** button to add it to the bottom of the build definition\.

Click on the new task to see its properties in the right pane\.

### Configure the Task Properties<a name="configure-the-task-properties"></a>
+ **AWS Credentials**

  If you have already configured AWS credentials for your project, you can select them from the dropdown list\. If not, you can add credentials for this task by choosing the **New** button next to the **AWS Credentials** field\. For information about filling out the resulting **Add AWS service connection** form, see the topic on [Supplying Task Credentials using a Service Endpoint](getting-started.md#supplying-task-credentials-using-a-service-endpoint)\.

  This task requires credentials for a user with a policy enabling the user to update an Elastic Beanstalk environment and describe an environment's status and events\.
**Note**  
We recommend that you do not use your account's root credentials\. Instead, create one or more IAM users, and then use those credentials\. For more information, see [Best Practices for Managing AWS Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html) in the *[Amazon Web Services General Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/)*\.
+ **AWS Region**

  Set the AWS region in which the Elastic Beanstalk environment is running; for example 'us\-east\-1', 'us\-west\-2', etc\.
+ **Application Name**

  The name you used to create the Elastic Beanstalk application\. An Elastic Beanstalk application is the container for the environment for the \.NET web application\.
+ **Environment Name**

  The name of the Elastic Beanstalk environment that is associated with the **Application Name**\. An Elastic Beanstalk environment contains the actual provisioned resources that are running the \.NET web application\.
+ **Deployment Bundle Type**

  Leave this field set to the default: **ASP\.NET \(Source: Web Deploy Archive\)**\.
+ **Web Deploy Archive**

  The *full path* to the Web Deploy archive, including the file name of the archive file, which has a "\.zip" extension\. The value for this field can be found in the *Build Solution* task, the **DesktopBuildPackageLocation** argument in the **MSBuild Arguments** field\. The directory part of the full path is also used in other tasks\.

  If, for example, the project was set up according to the instructions here, the value for this field will be "`$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\WebApp.zip`" \(without the quotes\)\.
**Note**  
Team Services provides a [number of variables](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=550988) that you can use to avoid hard\-coded paths\.
+ **Event poll delay \(seconds\)**

  The time, in seconds, to wait between calls to retrieve the latest events from the deployment to the environment\. The default is 5 seconds\. For large deployments or slow connections, you might need to increase this value\.

### Run the Build<a name="run-the-build"></a>

With the new task configured, you are ready to run the build\. Click the **Save and queue** option\.

![\[Save and Queue the Build\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vsts/latest/userguide/images/ebtaskfinal.png)

When the build has completed running you should see a log similar to the following\.
